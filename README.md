# Aviation Risk Analysis Project

## Overview

As part of the company's strategy to diversify its portfolio, we are exploring the potential risks associated with purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. This project aims to identify which aircraft types pose the lowest risk, providing actionable insights to inform the decision-making process.

## Business Understanding

### Stakeholder
- **Head of the New Aviation Division**

### Key Business Questions
1. Which aircraft types have the lowest incidence of severe damage in accidents?
2. How does the frequency of accidents vary across different aircraft categories and makes?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data
The data is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

### Description of Data
The dataset contains information on various aspects of aviation accidents, including, which are the variables that I decided to use for this analysis:
- **Event Date**: The date of the accident.
- **Location**: The location where the accident occurred.
- **Country**: The country in which the accident took place.
- **Injury Severity**: The severity of injuries resulting from the accident.
- **Aircraft Damage**: The extent of damage to the aircraft.
- **Aircraft Category**: The category of the aircraft (e.g., airplane, helicopter).
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the aircraft.
- **Total Fatal Injuries**: Number of fatal injuries.
- **Total Serious Injuries**: Number of serious injuries.
- **Total Minor Injuries**: Number of minor injuries.
- **Total Uninjured**: Number of uninjured persons.
- **Weather Condition**: The weather condition at the time of the accident.
- **Report Status**: The status of the accident report.

### Visualizations
1. **Accident Trends Over Time**

2. **Distribution of Aircraft Damage**

## Conclusion

### Summary of Conclusions
1. **Accident Trends**: The trend analysis shows fluctuations in the number of accidents over time, with notable peaks that may require further investigation to understand underlying causes.
2. **Aircraft Damage Distribution**: The majority of accidents result in substantial or minor damage to the aircraft, with fewer incidents leading to total destruction. This indicates varying levels of risk associated with different aircraft makes.

These findings will help guide the decision-making process for purchasing aircraft by identifying lower-risk options based on historical accident data. The insights derived from this analysis will support the strategic goals of the new aviation division, ensuring informed and data-driven choices.
